# Embedded Data Example

This example enables streaming of the sensor in raw format and visualizes the data using OpenCV.

Further the embedded data lines are extracted and visualized on stream.

```bash
python edl.py ?MAC ?nframes
# MAC     - (optional) mac address of Bottlenose to connect to or first one
# nframes - (optional) number of frames to aquire before exiting (runs headless)
```
